## 344. Reverse String

```
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
    Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
    Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```


### Solution (Two Pointer Approach)
```python
s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]

left, right = 0, len(s) - 1

while left < right:
    s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
    
    left += 1
    right -= 1
```

#### Time & Space Complexity Analysis
- __Time Complexity__
  - Asigning varialbe `left` and `right` will take constant time `O(1)`.
  - `while` loop running through from `left` to `right` which is run total number length
    of string, so it's time complexity is `O(n)`.
  - Swapping charcter of string will take `O(1)` constant time.
  - Increment and Decrement of `left` and `right` will take `O(1)` time.
  - So the dominated time complexity is `O(n)` where n is the length of string.

- __Space Compelxity__
  - Assignment of `left` and `right` will take `O(1)` space.
  - Swapping inside `s` will take `O(1)` also.
  - So the dominated time complexity is `O(1)`
