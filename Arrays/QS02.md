## 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
```
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.
Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

Example 1:
    Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
    Output: 5
```

### Solution 01 (Quick Select)
```python
    from random import randint

    def partition(arr, low, high, pivIndex):
        pivot = arr[pivIndex]
        i = low
        
        # Pivot move to last position
        arr[high], arr[pivIndex] = arr[pivIndex], arr[high]
        
        for j in range(low, high):
            if arr[j] > pivot:
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
                i += 1
                
        # Pivot move to it's correct position
        arr[i], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i]
        return i


    nums = [3,1,2,5,6,4]
    k = 4

    def quickselect(arr, low, high, k):
        if low == high:
            return arr[low]
        
        pivIndex = randint(low, high)
        pivIndex = partition(arr, low, high, pivIndex)
        
        if pivIndex == k-1:
            return arr[k-1]
        
        elif k > pivIndex:
            return quickselect(arr, pivIndex+1, high, k)
        else:
            return quickselect(arr, low, pivIndex, k)
        
        return -1
            

    quickselect(nums, 0, len(nums)-1, k) 
```

#### Time & Space Complexity Analysis
```
Time Complexity:

    __Partition Function__:
        The partition function takes O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in 
        the sub-array (high - low + 1).
        The partition function is called recursively until the sub-array size becomes 1.

    __Recursion__:
        In the worst case, each recursive call reduces the size of the array by one element.
        The worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), which occurs when the pivot selection 
        consistently results in unbalanced partitions.
        On average, the time complexity is O(n) due to random pivot selection.

        Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case and O(n) on average.

Space Complexity:

    The maximum depth of recursion is O(log n) in the average case (when the pivot selection is random).
    In the worst case (unbalanced partitioning), the recursion depth can be O(n).

### Solution 02 (Binary Search)
```python
import sys

def count(nums, mid):
    cnt = 0
    for num in nums:
        if mid >= num:
            cnt += 1
    return cnt

def kthsmallest(nums, k):
    low = sys.maxsize
    high = -sys.maxsize - 1
    
    for item in nums:
        low = min(low, item)
        high = max(high, item)
        
    while low < high:
        mid = low + (high-low) // 2
        
        if count(nums, mid) < k:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low
    
kthsmallest([7, 12, 13, 5, 6 ,23, 9], 1)
```

#### Time & Space Complexity Analysis
```
Time Complexity:
    O(n * log (mx-mn)), where mn be minimum and mx be maximum element of array.
Space Complexity:
    O(1)
```

### Solution 03 (Heap(Priority Queue))
```python
    import heapq

    def kthSmallest(arr, K):
        # Create a max heap (priority queue)
        max_heap = []

        # Iterate through the array elements
        for num in arr:
            # Push the negative of the current element onto the max heap
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -num)

            # If the size of the max heap exceeds K, remove the largest element
            if len(max_heap) > K:
                heapq.heappop(max_heap)

        # Return the Kth smallest element (top of the max heap, negated)
        return -max_heap[0]


    arr = [10, 5, 4, 3, 48, 6, 2, 33, 53, 10]
    K = 4

    # Function call
    print("Kth Smallest Element is:", kthSmallest(arr, K))
```
#### Time & Space Complexity Analysis
```
Time Complexity:
    Heap Push (Insert):
        Each element is pushed onto the max heap, and the heappush operation 
        has a time complexity of O(log K), where K is the size of the heap.

    Heap Pop (Remove Largest Element):
        If the size of the max heap exceeds K, the largest element is popped, 
        and the heappop operation also has a time complexity of O(log K).

    Overall:
        The loop iterates through each element in the array, performing 
        heap operations. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N log K), 
        where N is the number of elements in the array.

Space Complexity:
    The max heap stores at most K elements, so the space complexity is O(K).
