## 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
```
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.
Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

Example 1:
    Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
    Output: 5
```

### Solution 01 (Quick Select)
```python
    from random import randint

    def partition(arr, low, high, pivIndex):
        pivot = arr[pivIndex]
        i = low
        
        # Pivot move to last position
        arr[high], arr[pivIndex] = arr[pivIndex], arr[high]
        
        for j in range(low, high):
            if arr[j] > pivot:
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
                i += 1
                
        # Pivot move to it's currect position
        arr[i], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i]
        return i


    nums = [3,1,2,5,6,4]
    k = 4

    def quickselect(arr, low, high, k):
        if low == high:
            return arr[low]
        
        pivIndex = randint(low, high)
        pivIndex = partition(arr, low, high, pivIndex)
        
        if pivIndex == k-1:
            return arr[k-1]
        
        elif k > pivIndex:
            return quickselect(arr, pivIndex+1, high, k)
        else:
            return quickselect(arr, low, pivIndex, k)
        
        return -1
            

    quickselect(nums, 0, len(nums)-1, k) 
```

#### Time & Space Complexity Analysis
```
Time Complexity:

    __Partition Function__:
        The partition function takes O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in 
        the sub-array (high - low + 1).
        The partition function is called recursively until the sub-array size becomes 1.

    __Recursion__:
        In the worst case, each recursive call reduces the size of the array by one element.
        The worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), which occurs when the pivot selection 
        consistently results in unbalanced partitions.
        On average, the time complexity is O(n) due to random pivot selection.

        Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case and O(n) on average.

Space Complexity:

    The maximum depth of recursion is O(log n) in the average case (when the pivot selection is random).
    In the worst case (unbalanced partitioning), the recursion depth can be O(n).
