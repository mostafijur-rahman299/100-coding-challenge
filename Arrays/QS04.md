## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
```
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a 
different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. 
If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:
    Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 5
```

### Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        buy = 0
        sell = 1
        max_profit = 0

        while sell < len(prices):
            if prices[buy] < prices[sell]:                
                current_profit =  prices[sell] - prices[buy]
                max_profit = max(current_profit, max_profit)
                
            else:
                buy = sell
            
            sell += 1
        return max_profit
```
