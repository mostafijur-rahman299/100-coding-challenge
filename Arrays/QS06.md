## Find Missing And Repeating
```
Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2,....,N} 
is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

Example:
    input: [2,2] 2
    output: 2,1
```


### Solution 01
```python
def findTwoElement(arr, n):
    temp = [0]*n
    repeating = 0
    missing=0
    
    for i in range(n):
        temp[arr[i]-1] += 1
        
    for i in range(len(temp)):
        if temp[i] > 1:
            repeating = i + 1
        elif temp[i] < 1:
            missing = i + 1
    return repeating, missing 
 
arr = [7, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 2]
printTwoElements(arr)
```
