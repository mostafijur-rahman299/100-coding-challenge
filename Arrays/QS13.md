88. Merge Sorted Array
```
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

 

Example 1:
    Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
    Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```


### Solution
```python
a, b, write_index = m-1, n-1, m+n-1
while b >= 0:
    if a >= 0 and nums1[a] > nums2[b]:
        nums1[write_index] = nums1[a]
        a -= 1
    else:
        nums1[write_index] = nums2[b]
        b -= 1
    write_index -= 1
```
#### Time & Space Complexity
```
Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the array 2
Space Complexity: O(1)
```
