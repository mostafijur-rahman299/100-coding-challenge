# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String
```
Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example:
    Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
    Output: [0,6]
```

## Solution 01 (Two Pointer)
```python
    from collections import Counter

    s = "cbaebabacd"
    p = "abc"

    l = 0
    r = len(p)

    pc = Counter(p)
    indices = []

    while r < len(s):
        if Counter(s[l:r]) == pc:
            indices.append(l)
        
        l += 1
        r += 1
        

    print(indices)
```
