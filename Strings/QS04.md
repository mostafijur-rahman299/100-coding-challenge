## Check if given strings are rotations of each other or not

```
Given a string s1 and a string s2, write a function to check whether s2 is a rotation of s1. 

Examples: 
    Input: S1 = ABCD, S2 = CDAB
    Output: Strings are rotations of each other

    Input: S1 = ABCD, S2 = ACBD
    Output: Strings are not rotations of each other
```
### Solution 01

```python
s1 = "ABCD"
s2 = "BCDA"


s1_indices = {}
index = 0
for char in s1:
    s1_indices[char]=index
    index += 1

current_char = 0
next_char = current_char + 1

while next_char < len(s2):
        
    if s1_indices[s2[current_char]] == 0:
        if s1_indices[s2[next_char]] != 1 and s1_indices[s2[next_char]] != len(s1)-1:
            print("Not a rotation1")
            break
    elif s1_indices[s2[current_char]] == len(s1)-1:
        if s1_indices[s2[next_char]] != 0 and s1_indices[s2[next_char]] != s1_indices[s2[current_char]] - 1:
            print("Not a rotation2")
            break
    else:
        if s1_indices[s2[current_char]] != s1_indices[s2[next_char]] + 1 \
        and s1_indices[s2[current_char]] != s1_indices[s2[next_char]] - 1:
            print("Not a rotation3")
            break
            
    
    current_char += 1
    next_char += 1
```

#### Time & Space Complexity Analysis
```
__Time Complexity__:
    The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the string s2. 
    This is because the while loop iterates through each character of s2 once, 
    and the operations inside the loop are constant time operations 
    (e.g., dictionary lookups, comparisons, and arithmetic operations)

__Space Complexity__:
    The space complexity is O(m), where m is the length of s1. 
    This is because the code uses a dictionary s1_indices to store 
    the indices of characters in s1. The size of the dictionary 
    is determined by the number of unique characters in s1. 
    In the worst case, where all characters in s1 are unique, 
    the space complexity is O(m). However, if there are fewer unique characters, 
    the space complexity would be less than O(m).

    In addition to the dictionary, there are a few integer variables 
    (index, current_char, next_char), but these occupy constant space 
    regardless of the input size.
