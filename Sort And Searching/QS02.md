## 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

```
Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, 
return the kth smallest element in the matrix.

Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).

Example 1:

    Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
    Output: 13
    Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13

Example 2:

    Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
    Output: -5
```

### Solution 01 (binary search)
```python
matrix = [
    [1,5,9],
    [10,11,13],
    [12,13,15]
]
k = 8

def count_smaller_or_equal(matrix, target):
    count = 0
    n = len(matrix)
    i = n - 1
    j = 0
    
    while i >= 0 and j < n:
        if matrix[i][j] <= target:
            count += i + 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i -= 1
    return count

def kth_smallest2(matrix, k):
    n = len(matrix)
    low = matrix[0][0]
    high = matrix[n - 1][n - 1]

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        count = count_smaller_or_equal(matrix, mid)
        if count < k:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low

kth_smallest2(matrix, k)
